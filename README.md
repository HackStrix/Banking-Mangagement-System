Banking Management System - Using python &amp; mysql


## INTRODUCTION

Initially, the program displays a menu on the screen with the following options: 
1. New Account: This option is chosen if the user wants to open a new account and is hence directed to a set of statements which asks for subsequent information to open a new account. 

2. View Account: This option is chosen if the user wants to view the list of created accounts present in the system. 

3. Search Account: This option is chosen if the user wants to search his/her account (display all the details of the searched account) in the available database of created accounts. 

4. Deposit Money: This option is chosen if the user wants to deposit any amount of money to his/her existing checking or savings account and hence the balance money in the account is updated. 

5. Withdraw Money: This option is chosen if the user wants to withdraw any amount of money out of his/her existing checking or savings account and hence the balance money in the account is updated. 

6. Transfer Money: This option is chosen if the user wants to transfer any amount of money from his/her checkings account to another user’s checkings account and hence the balance money in the account of both the users is updated. 

7. Savings to Checkings / Checkings to Savings: This option is chosen if the user wants to transfer any amount of money from his/her checkings account to savings account (or vica-versa) and hence the balance money in both the types of accounts is updated. 

8. Delete Account: This option is chosen if the user wants to close any account that he/she has created.

9. Quit: This option is chosen if the user wants to exit the program.
For selecting any of the above options the user is given a choice to enter a letter (each letter corresponds to a choice in the above displayed menu) and depending on the user’s input, subsequent action is taken. 
Each option on the menu triggers a certain set of statements that first ask the user to select or give the account number to which he/she wants to make changes (considering that a user can make multiple accounts by clicking on New Account option) and then the subsequent action is taken.
